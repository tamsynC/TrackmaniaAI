## Resources
- To edit your README file, follow these [markdown instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
- This video explains how to set up a GitHub page that you can use as a portfolio. The page is an edited version of the [nerfies](https://github.com/nerfies/nerfies.github.io) website.
- Alternatively, you can use a Jekyll theme for your project page ([see documentation here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)).
